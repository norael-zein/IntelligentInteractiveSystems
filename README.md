Mindfulness Master Class is a system that mimics a mindfulness coach by providing adaptive and contextually meaningful responses based on users' emotional states and speech. The system consists of two parts: The first part captures emotional expressions through image analysis and machine learning models that predict emotions. The second part is an interaction system where users engage with a robot from Furhat robotics. This robot processes both emotional and speech inputs during interactions.
